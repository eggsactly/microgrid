# About

This git repo holds simulations for a City of Tucson Microgrid proposal in 2023.

# Files

| File           | Description   |

| building-ac.py | Models AC utilization and power consumption of a building based on its volume, insulation, and outside temperatures |
| microgrid.py   | Intent of this file is to model line losses of a DC distribution network | 

# Purpose
Intent of this repo is to provide predictive capacity to support cost modeling 
of microgrid proposals. This is necessary because Climate Change will break 
assumptions about energy consumption and human behavior that may not be fully 
captured with traditional modeling approaches. Therefore numeric models based 
on first principles can offer valuable insight into non-linear phenomena that 
will be increasingly common in the future.
